        It's useless, don't do this, it's hubris to try
        He's ruthless, you knew this, I told you, didn't I?
        He's abusive, elusive, the truth is he lies
        I know you don't want to let go
        And just like before, I can see that you're sure
        You can change him, but I know you won't
        The devil doesn't bargain, he'll only break your heart again
        It isn't worth it, darling, he's never gonna change
        He'll never be Prince Charming, he'll only do you harm again
        I don't mean to meddle, but the devil doesn't settle
        No, the devil doesn't bargain
        Mm, mm, mm, mm
        The devil doesn't bargain
        Mm, mm, mm, mm
        I'm not one to lecture, talk down to a friend
        I don't mean to pressure, mean to condescend
        But I just want what's best for you in the end
        I know you don't want to let go
        And just like before, I can see that you're sure
        You can change him, but I know you won't
        The devil doesn't bargain, he'll only break your heart again
        It isn't worth it, darling, he's never gonna change
        He'll never be Prince Charming, he'll only do you harm again
        I don't mean to meddle, but the devil doesn't settle
        No, the devil doesn't bargain
        Mm, mm, mm, mm
        The devil doesn't bargain
        Mm, mm, mm, mm
        And I know you think he'll change this time
        But I think that you will find
        The devil doesn't bargain, he'll only break your heart again
        It isn't worth it, darling, he's never gonna change
        He'll never be Prince Charming, he'll only do you harm again
        I don't mean to meddle, but the devil doesn't settle
